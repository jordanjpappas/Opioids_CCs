# Dynamics in drug-related disorders from 1999-2019 in the U.S.

In this repository, we share all code related to an ongoing project focused on describing trends in deaths from mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive drug use. Our focus is on the 1999-2019 period. We juxtapose these trends against the same dynamics in fatal drug overdoses.

The basic code structure is as follows:

All scripts starting with **1-** generate the data used in the study. All scripts starting with **2-** are used for visualizations/tabulations of deaths related to certain underlying and/or contributing causes of death. All scripts starting with **3-** are used for supplementary work.

*The authors of this code include Meredith Adams, Andrew Boslett, Alina Denham, Elaine Hill, and Jordan Pappas.*
